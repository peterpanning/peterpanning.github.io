I recently attended an interview workshop held by Google at San Francisco State University.
While fascinating, one of the most profound effects of this talk on me was to make
me realize "Oh God Oh God I need to study." I started looking for different forms
of interview prep online and it seems that although there are a variety of sites,
books, etc. intended to help candidates get up to speed, none of them have everything
in one place.

So I decided to put everything that I'm about to study all in one place.

First off, here are some general interview prep and interviewing tips:

Interview prep:

Code by hand. Writing your code out by hand reflects the worst-case scenario of
a whiteboard interview, without an IDE or compiler by your side. It forces you to
truly commit to memory the language and concepts you will be studying and helps
you overcome some of the pitfalls of writing by hand--my own handwriting is
basically chicken scratch as far as readability goes, for example. And what do
you do if you realize you have to insert a block of code somewhere in the middle
of a block you've already written? What if you just run out of space? Which methods
are appropriate to abbreviate, and which should you really write out every time?
How many single-character variable names can you use before your code is readable,
but indecipherable? Practicing writing code by hand will help you learn how to
overcome these obstacles so that you don't panic if and when you run into them
during an interview.

Plan to interview in Python.
* Python is succinct: compare `print "Hello, world!"` to `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`
* Python is powerful: it lets you quickly and easily write object-oriented code
* Python is ubiquitous enough that any company should be comfortable allowing you to use it
* Python is simple enough that you're not likely to mess up syntax (no pointers etc.)

While interviewing:

Ask questions. This was probably the biggest takeaway for me during the Google
talk. Asking a quick question before you even start solving the problem you're
tasked with can save you a lot of time in a lot of ways.

More on these later when I have the notes I took during the talk.

What follows is an exhaustive list of topics that you might expect to see during
an interview for a software engineer as a new graduate.

* Data Structures:
  * Arrays
  * Strings
  * Linked Lists
  * Stacks
  * Queues
  * Trees
* Algorithms
  * Searching
  * Sorting
* OOP:
  * Polymorphism

* Complexity
* Recursion
* Scalability and Memory Limits
* Testing
* Operating Systems:
  * Threads and Locking
* Math and Logic:
  * Graph Theory
  * Linear Algebra
  * Probability and Statistics
